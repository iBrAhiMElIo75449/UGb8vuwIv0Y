## How to contribute

Use pull requests to contribute to the project.

Stick to the following format:

\<details>
<summary>[Question]</summary><br><b>

[Answer]
\</b></details>

* If you added several questions and you would like to know how many questions are there you can use the script "count_questions.sh" in scripts directory.

## What to avoid

* Avoid adding installation questions. Those are the worst type of questions...
* If you add new images, make sure they are free and can be used.

## Before submitting the pull request

You can test your changes locally with the script `run_ci.sh` in scripts directory.
